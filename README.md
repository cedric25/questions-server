A simple Node.js server asking random questions to a list of players

Before using this little server, you have to create a ./server/clients.json file, looking like:

```json
[  
  {  
  "name": "Arthur",  
    "ip": "localhost:3001"  
  },  
  {  
    "name": "Bob",  
    "ip": "localhost:3002"  
  },  
  {  
    "name": "Charles",  
    "ip": "localhost:3003"  
  }
]
```
